TODO: fix up proper documentation.

For now, here's a list of links.


- https://github.com/ddsc/ddsc-project/issues?labels=Requirement

  The full list of (Dutch) high-level requirements from the official list. We
  can use that to link to and from the actual work that we do (issues or
  commits) to these requirements. This gives a clear connection between
  functionality and requirements.

- https://github.com/ddsc

  The organization on github. For repository access, ask
  https://github.com/reinout or https://github.com/berto-nens .
